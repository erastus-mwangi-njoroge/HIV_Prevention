# HIV Prevention in Adolescents: Kenya Analysis
This analysis examines HIV prevention indicators among Kenyan adolescents (15-24 years) from 2003-2022, focusing on comprehensive HIV knowledge, testing behaviors, and access to testing services. The findings reveal significant progress and the persistent disparities


## 📊 Overview

This comprehensive data analysis project examines HIV prevention indicators among Kenyan adolescents (ages 15-24) from 2003 to 2022. The analysis focuses on key metrics including comprehensive HIV knowledge, testing behaviors, and access to testing services, with particular attention to equity dimensions such as gender, education, residence, wealth, and marital status.
